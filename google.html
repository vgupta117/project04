            Google was founded in September 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University in California. Together they own about 14% of its shares and control 56% of the stockholder voting power through super-voting stock. Google was incorporated in California on September 4, 1998. Google was then reincorporated in Delaware on October 22, 2002.[13] In July 2003, Google moved to its headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex. The company became a public company via an initial public offering (IPO) on August 19, 2004. In October 2015, Google reorganized as a subsidiary of a conglomerate called Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet's Internet interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. In 2021, the Alphabet Workers Union was founded, mainly composed of Google employees.[14]

          <h2>Brief History</h2>
          <p>
            Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both PhD students at Stanford University in California.[19][20][21] The project initially involved an unofficial "third founder", Scott Hassan, the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original Google Search engine, but he left before Google was officially founded as a company;[22][23] Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company Willow Garage in 2006.[24][25]
          </p>

          <p>
            While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites.[26] They called this algorithm PageRank; it determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site.[27][28] Page told his ideas to Hassan, who began writing the code to implement Page's ideas.[22]

            Page and Brin originally nicknamed the new search engine "BackRub", because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site.[19][29][30] Hassan as well as Alan Steremberg were cited by Page and Brin as being critical to the development of Google. Rajeev Motwani and Terry Winograd later co-authored with Page and Brin the first paper about the project, describing PageRank and the initial prototype of the Google search engine, published in 1998. Héctor García-Molina and Jeff Ullman were also cited as contributors to the project.[31] PageRank was influenced by a similar page-ranking and site-scoring algorithm earlier used for RankDex, developed by Robin Li in 1996, with Larry Page's PageRank patent including a citation to Li's earlier RankDex patent; Li later went on to create the Chinese search engine Baidu.[32][33]</p>

          <p>
            Eventually, they changed the name to Google; the name of the search engine was a play on the word "googol",[19][34][35] the number 1 followed by 100 zeros, which was picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information.[36]
            The domain name www.google.com was registered on September 15, 1997,[38] and the company was incorporated on September 4, 1998. It was based in the garage of (Susan Wojcicki[21]) in Menlo Park, California. Craig Silverstein, a fellow PhD student at Stanford, was hired as the first employee.[21][39][40]
            Google was initially funded by an August 1998 contribution of $100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim,[19] co-founder of Sun Microsystems; the money was given before Google was incorporated.[41][42] Google received money from three other angel investors in 1998: Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, Stanford University computer science professor David Cheriton, and entrepreneur Ram Shriram.[43] Between these initial investors, friends, and family Google raised around $1,000,000, which is what allowed them to open up their original shop in Menlo Park, California.[44]
            After some additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999,[43] a new $25 million round of funding was announced on June 7, 1999,[45] with major investors including the venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital.[42]</p>

          <h2>Products & Services</h2>
          <p>
            The company's rapid growth since incorporation has included products, acquisitions, and partnerships beyond Google's core search engine, (Google Search). It offers services designed for work and productivity (Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides), email (Gmail), scheduling and time management (Google Calendar), cloud storage (Google Drive), instant messaging and video chat (Google Duo, Hangouts, Google Chat, and Google Meet), language translation (Google Translate), mapping and navigation (Google Maps, Waze, Google Earth, and Street View), podcast hosting (Google Podcasts), video sharing (YouTube), blog publishing (Blogger), note-taking (Google Keep and Jamboard), and photo organizing and editing (Google Photos). 
          </p>
          <p>
            The company leads the development of the Android mobile operating system, the Google Chrome web browser, and Chrome OS, a lightweight operating system based on the Chrome browser. Google has moved increasingly into hardware; from 2010 to 2015, it partnered with major electronics manufacturers in the production of its Google Nexus devices, and it released multiple hardware products in October 2016, including the Google Pixel line of smartphones, Google Home smart speaker, Google Wifi mesh wireless router, and Google Daydream virtual reality headset. Google has also experimented with becoming an Internet carrier (Google Fiber, Google Fi, and Google Station).Google.com is the most visited website worldwide. Several other Google-owned websites also are on the list of most popular websites, including YouTube and Blogger.[16]

          <h2>Financial Earnings</h2>
          <p>
            In the most recently reported fiscal year, Google's revenue amounted to 181.69 billion US dollars. Google's revenue is largely made up by advertising revenue, which amounted to 146.9 billion US dollars in 2020. As of June 2019, parent company Alphabet ranked fourth among worldwide internet companies, with a market capitalization of 741 billion U.S. dollars.
          </p>
          <p>
            Google's initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004. At IPO, the company offered 19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share.[59][60] The sale of $1.67 billion gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23 billion.[63] The stock performed well after the IPO, with shares hitting $350 for the first time on October 31, 2007,[176] primarily because of strong sales and earnings in the online advertising market.[177] The surge in stock price was fueled mainly by individual investors, as opposed to large institutional investors and mutual funds.[177] GOOG shares split into GOOG class C shares and GOOGL class A shares.[178] The company is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbols GOOGL and GOOG, and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol GGQ1. These ticker symbols now refer to Alphabet Inc., Google's holding company, since the fourth quarter of 2015.[179]
          </p>
          <p>
            In the third-quarter of 2005, Google reported a 700% increase in profit, largely due to large companies shifting their advertising strategies from newspapers, magazines, and television to the Internet.[180][181][182]
            For the 2006 fiscal year, the company reported $10.492 billion in total advertising revenues and only $112 million in licensing and other revenues.[183] In 2011, 96% of Google's revenue was derived from its advertising programs.[184]

            The year 2012 was the first time that Google generated $50 billion in annual revenue for the first time in 2012, generating $38 billion the previous year. In January 2013, then-CEO Larry Page commented, "We ended 2012 with a strong quarter ... Revenues were up 36% year-on-year, and 8% quarter-on-quarter. And we hit $50 billion in revenues for the first time last year – not a bad achievement in just a decade and a half."[185]

            Google's consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2013 was reported in mid-October 2013 as $14.89 billion, a 12 percent increase compared to the previous quarter.[186] Google's Internet business was responsible for $10.8 billion of this total, with an increase in the number of users' clicks on advertisements.[187] By January 2014, Google's market capitalization had grown to $397 billion.[188]
