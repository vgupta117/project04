##DMS290 project 4: Customized Website with a CSS Framework**

**Information Architect (IA)**: Brian Jesse Kimani

**Visual Designer (VD)**: Vikram Gupta

**Website**: Top Tech Companies of the World!

**Description**: The website provides information about the top tech companies of the world as of May 2021: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google including their founders & current leadership, history and current events, headquarters location, products and services, and financials.

## **Variations from original visual design:**
1. The tech company layout sketches showed a paired card layout.  While we kept the card layout, we decided to make the subsections have varying sized cards to provide a better visual flow and showcase the content better.

2. Original design had chosen a golden border which didnt fit in with the rest of the theme. We switched to the darker secondary color for the border which was more in harmony with the rest of the page.
