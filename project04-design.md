# **Project 4 Visual Design**

This document describes the visual design of the website showing the top big tech companies of the world.

## **Layouts**

**Landing Page**
We will use a z-pattern layout for the landing page with links to each of the pages for the companies in the order described in the project architecture document.  The main focus area should be a carousel of images linking to each of the tech company pages.

**Tech Company Pages**
Tech company pages will use a Card layout which will render the information chosen by the Information Architect as described in the project architecture document in pairs.


## **Color Pallet**
Dark theme with sharp contrast

## **Typography**
Font Family : Lato paired Roboto
[Lato Pairings](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato#pairings)
Lato is a sans serif typeface family with classical proportions that give harmony and elegance.  The semi-rounded details of the letters gives Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness.  This fits the mood and purpose of a tech company website.

Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesnâ€™t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types.
